A collection of functions for importing, processing, and analyzing raking light texture images.

Requires:

- numpy
- scipy
- matplotlib
- PIL
- pickle
- skimage
- sklearn
- steerablepyrtexture



## Basics

The texture_tools file contains the core functions for importing and procesing raking light texture images.

Example steps for processing a folder of raking light images and then extracting features are in example.py

## Examples

A tutorial on some of the functions and features for texture processing.

## Glyphs

Predicting texture glyph values from steerable pyramid features.
